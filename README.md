# Note-Taker-Using-Express.js

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description 

This project is a Note Taker that uses Express.js on the back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

While I cannot take credit for the front end, it is the Express.js that gives this application its power.

When a user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with an entry link.

Once the user enters the main screen, they can easily enter a subject, add notes, save that note, view previous notes, and/or delete notes.
